## ✨ 4. Highlighting and Insight Extraction
✅ Demonstration:
NotebookLM underlines key terms like Random Forest, Information Gain, Overfitting. It allows the student to cross-compare how often these techniques are mentioned and in what context.

# 🧠 Analysis:

i. Accuracy & Relevance: Captures keyword frequency effectively. Misses nuance in usage (e.g., “bagging” vs. “boosting”).

ii. Usefulness: Enhances literature synthesis, especially in methodology review.

iii. Limitations:

Focuses on frequency, not importance.

Prone to bias toward well-known methods, neglecting novel techniques.

No capability to filter results by date, impact, or author credibility.
