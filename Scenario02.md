✨ 2. Automatic Summarization

✅ Demonstration:
The student generates summaries of all five articles. Each summary condenses the study’s goal, dataset, technique, and findings into under 300 words. For example:

“This study compares CART and CHAID for predicting churn, finding CHAID performs better on recall but has higher false positives.”

🧠 Analysis:

i. Accuracy & Relevance: Captures key points but may omit details like sample size or statistical confidence.

ii. Usefulness: Ideal for screening multiple papers and reducing reading load.

iii. Limitations:

Risk of oversimplification.

May hallucinate interpretations when article structure is weak.

Students must still verify claims in the full text.
