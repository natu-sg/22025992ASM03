## Description
A student uploads 5 academic articles and asks:

> "What are the most common limitations of using decision trees in business analytics?"

NotebookLM responds by:
- Highlighting 3 articles with relevant answers
- Quoting paragraphs directly from those sources

## Evaluation
- **Accuracy & Relevance:** High. Returned paragraphs contain terminology like "overfitting", "low interpretability", and "bias in categorical splitting", all aligned with textbook definitions.
- **Academic Usefulness:** Very useful for cross-comparing sources without manually scanning PDFs.
- **Limitations:** Cannot detect nuances like outdated or low-quality sources.

## Conclusion
This feature enhances critical review skills and is suitable for production with human oversight.
