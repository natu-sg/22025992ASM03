## ✨ Scenario 01: Peer-review articles Q&A

✅ Demonstration:
The student uploads five peer-reviewed articles and asks:

“What are the most common limitations of using decision trees in marketing analytics?”

NotebookLM highlights relevant excerpts from three sources, referencing overfitting, lack of generalization, and interpretability issues.

# 🧠 Analysis:

i. Accuracy & Relevance: NotebookLM accurately quotes relevant content and does not fabricate responses when data is unavailable.

ii. Usefulness: Excellent for research queries, literature review, and comparative analysis.

iii. Limitations:

Does not evaluate source contradictions.

No weighting of evidence strength.

Low hallucination risk due to grounded quoting.
